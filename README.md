# HangMan Game

## Overview

This is a simple **HangMan** game implemented in Python. The game allows players to guess a hidden word by entering letters, aiming to guess the word before running out of attempts. It's a great project for practicing Python programming and basic game logic.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can input guesses and receive feedback.
- **Dynamic Word Pool**: A list of words is used to randomly select the target word.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear instructions and error handling for invalid inputs.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks the player's progress and remaining attempts.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Princ3k/HangMan.git
   cd HangMan
   ```

2. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to start playing!

## How to Play

1. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. The player is prompted to guess one letter at a time.
3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position(s).
4. If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses one attempt.
5. The game ends when the player successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## File Structure

- **hangman.py**: Main Python script containing the game logic.
- **words.txt** *(optional)*: A file containing a list of words for the game (if implemented).

## Customization

- **Word List**: Add more words to the list in the script or load them from an external file for variety.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Modify the number of attempts to make the game easier or harder.
- **Graphics**: Add ASCII art to represent the HangMan stages for a more visual experience.
